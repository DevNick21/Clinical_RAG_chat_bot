\section{Detailed Statistical Analysis}

Our comprehensive evaluation reveals significant insights into clinical RAG system performance across 54 model combinations. The statistical distribution of performance metrics provides a foundation for evidence-based model selection in healthcare applications.

\input{chap4_results/tables/system_statistics}

The performance distribution shows a relatively tight clustering of scores around the mean (0.706), with a standard deviation indicating consistent quality across configurations. Notably, the minimum score (0.626) still represents clinically acceptable performance, while the maximum (0.770) demonstrates the potential for high-quality medical AI systems.

\subsection{Performance Variability Analysis}

The coefficient of variation for average scores (6.2\%) indicates good consistency across model combinations, suggesting that the RAG architecture provides stable performance regardless of specific component choices. However, search time variability (CV = 99.8\%) reveals significant efficiency differences, highlighting the importance of model selection for deployment scenarios with strict latency requirements.

\subsection{Embedding Model Performance Patterns}

The embedding model analysis reveals a clear performance hierarchy, with **multi-qa-mpnet** leading at 0.730 average score, followed closely by **mpnet-v2** (0.718) and **mini-lm** (0.716). Interestingly, medical-specialized embeddings show mixed results:

\textbf{Medical Specialization Analysis:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BioBERT} (0.716): Strong performance from biomedical pre-training
    \item \textbf{MedQuAD} (0.713): Specialized medical Q\&A training shows benefits
    \item \textbf{BioLORD} (0.689): Despite medical focus, performance below general models
    \item \textbf{biomedbert} (0.692): Medical specialization doesn't guarantee superiority
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Key Finding}: General-purpose embeddings with question-answering specialization (multi-qa) outperform domain-specific medical embeddings, suggesting that QA task alignment may be more important than medical domain knowledge for RAG retrieval.

\subsection{Large Language Model Performance Analysis}

LLM performance shows less variation than embedding models, with scores ranging from 0.696 (qwen) to 0.717 (tinyllama). This narrow range suggests that the embedding component has greater impact on overall system performance than LLM selection.

\textbf{Model Size vs Performance:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{TinyLlama (1.1B)}: 0.717 - Best average performance despite smallest size
    \item \textbf{Llama3.2}: 0.716 - Strong performance from instruction tuning
    \item \textbf{Phi3 (3.8B)}: 0.709 - Largest model, moderate performance
    \item \textbf{DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B)}: 0.701 - Reasoning focus, competitive results
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Surprising Result}: The smallest model (TinyLlama) achieved the highest average performance, challenging assumptions about parameter count correlating with quality in specialized domains.

\section{Clinical Category Performance Analysis}

Medical question categories show distinct performance patterns that reflect the complexity and structure of different types of clinical information:

\subsection{High-Performance Categories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Diagnoses}: 100\% average pass rate - Benefits from structured ICD coding
    \item \textbf{Header Information}: 91\% pass rate - Well-structured administrative data
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Challenging Categories}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Laboratory Results}: Complex numerical interpretation and reference ranges
    \item \textbf{Prescriptions}: Medication dosing and interaction complexity
    \item \textbf{Procedures}: Technical medical procedure descriptions
\end{itemize}

\section{Advanced Performance Metrics}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Highest overall score (0.770)
    \item Perfect reliability (100\% pass rate)
    \item Moderate speed (67.7s)
    \item Medical domain specialization advantage
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Balance-Optimized (multi-qa + llama):}

    \item Fast retrieval (56.5s)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Safety and Hallucination Analysis}

All top configurations maintain hallucination rates below 25\%, with medical-specialized combinations showing superior safety profiles. The BioBERT + phi3 combination achieves only 15\% hallucination rate while maintaining top performance, making it ideal for safety-critical clinical applications.

\section{Clinical Deployment Recommendations}

Based on comprehensive performance analysis, we provide evidence-based recommendations for different clinical deployment scenarios:

\subsection{High-Accuracy Clinical Decision Support}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{High-Throughput Clinical Applications}

\end{itemize}

\section{Statistical Significance and Confidence Intervals}

Performance differences between top configurations are statistically significant (p < 0.05, ANOVA), confirming that model selection has meaningful impact on clinical RAG system performance. The 95\% confidence intervals for top performers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item BioBERT + phi3: 0.770 ± 0.024
    \item multi-qa + phi3: 0.769 ± 0.027  
    \item multi-qa + llama: 0.764 ± 0.022
\end{itemize}

These narrow confidence intervals indicate robust performance estimates suitable for clinical deployment decision-making.

\section{Performance Insights and Clinical Implications}

\subsection{Domain Specialization vs Task Specialization}
The results challenge conventional wisdom about domain-specific models. Question-answering specialization (multi-qa embeddings) proves more valuable than medical domain specialization, suggesting that RAG systems benefit more from retrieval task alignment than domain knowledge pre-training.

\subsection{Efficiency-Quality Trade-offs}
Unlike many AI systems, our clinical RAG implementation shows weak correlation between quality and speed. This enables selection of fast, high-quality configurations for real-time clinical applications without significant performance compromise.

\subsection{Safety Considerations for Clinical Deployment}
All configurations maintain acceptable hallucination rates for healthcare applications (\textless45\%), with medical-specialized models showing superior safety profiles. The consistent disclaimer generation (100\% across all models) demonstrates appropriate clinical caution.

\subsection{Scalability and Resource Optimization}
The strong performance of smaller models (TinyLlama, mini-lm) provides cost-effective deployment options for resource-constrained healthcare environments while maintaining clinical-grade performance standards.

These comprehensive results provide healthcare organizations with evidence-based guidance for implementing clinical RAG systems tailored to their specific performance, safety, and efficiency requirements.
